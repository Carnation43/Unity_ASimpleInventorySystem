  specificDescription: Slowly retrieves the <color=#990000>innocence</color> of childhood
    upon use
  storyDescription: "\"It grows in a crack beside a pile of abandoned toys, its skin
    stained with crayon crumbs. Once a child hid it in the belly of a teddy bear,
    saying 'When I grow up, I'll take it to see the real sun' \u2014 but the child
    left, the teddy bear rotted, and it still bore a faint glow in the dark, relying
    on that half-sentence promise.\""
